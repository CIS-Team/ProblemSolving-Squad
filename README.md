#### [Junior training sheet (by: Dr. Mostafa Saad)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iJZWP2nS_OB3kCTjq8L6TrJJ4o-5lhxDOyTaocSYc-k/edit#gid=84654839)

#### Dr. Mostafa Saad:

    Please, check out the sheet before reading. The sheet is:

    Complete and consistent roadmap for newcomers: What to solve & algorithms to learn in order

    In the bottom row, there are different sheet pages such as Faq, Topics, CF-C2

    CF-C1, C2 are (Codeforces Div2 C problems (or similar level from other OJs), but from easy to hard). Same for CF-D1, D2, D3

    Covering most of the topics needed up to Codeforces Div2-D

    Problems increase in difficulty per topic with intermediate easy/medium problems + ad-hoc problems

    Speed problems to maintain speed goals


+ ### One can train in one of the following ways:

    - #### Blind-Order training style:

            Problems are distributed in sheets CF-A, CF-B, CF-C1, ....CF-D3

            It targets learning the knowledge/skills in a consistent and balanced way

            Every sheet page is on average harder than the previous sheet page

            This is my recommended way, though most camps/training-approaches don't use this style

    + #### Topics-Based training style:

            See the sheet page (Topics1). It has the same sheet problems (CF-A to CF-D3) ordered by category and level, around 950 problems. Also checkout Topics2 page

            Ideas Quality column: P5 (important), P4(very interesting), P3(interesting), P2(good), P1(ok), Empty (normal)

            You can train using Blind-Order, and use Topics page as a guide to skip some problems

            Advantage: Mastering the algorithm till solving some hard problems in a short time

            Disadvantage: Discovering the algorithm behind the problem is an important skill. Given that you know the topic, you lose a good space to improve this skill

            Disadvantage: Being in the mode of specific algorithm lets you solve many of it easier. However, when solving in real contests, your mind is not so active on the specific topic
